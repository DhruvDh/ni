# Making Javascript Reactive

Here is what you'er going to do -
- First you'll write out the code for the reactivity implementation
	- You'll first make a `data` object and put `a` and `b` into it.
	- You'll create a `c` variable and set it `data.a + data.b`.
	- You'll put `c` inside `computed`.
	- You'll walk through `data` and add some

- Then you'll start writing about the whole thing, start to finsh, which you'll do in one day. Fucking do it or I will never let you talk to Nishita again.
