# Preface

> This page lays out the reason this website exists, and how it attempts to help a prospective student. If you're here just to learn, feel free to skip this page and go on to [the next one](1_introduction.html).

This is an [open-source website](https://github.com/DhruvDh/ni) thats written with the intention of getting an average student in Computer Science or the like getting them up to speed on the intricacies of modern web development.

The making of this website is primarily fueled by my lack of faith in most educational institutions, especially those in third-world countries, being any good at teaching their students and preparing them for a satisfying and productive career in the industry.

I'd prefer to not go on and start ranting in the first page of this website, so rather than elaborate on my reasoning behind the earlier statement I would rather direct you to a chapter in the book "Surely, you're joking Mr. Feynman" [1], where Dr. Richard Feynman - a noble prize winning physicist who is considered by many to be one of the best teachers of his time - gives a speech about his experience teaching in a third-world country (Brazil), and what he thinks about the state of the education system there. I believe very little has changed since.

## Why web development?

Okay, so I don't like the current state of education - how does one go from there to writing about web development?

In the years following the first launch of the iPhone and the subsequent flurry of Android phones the value proposition of a smartphone application or a web application for any consumer-facing business and increased exponentially.

Now about a decade later there is an excess of job opportunities for someone who is capable developer of applications or 'apps`, and not enough trained talent. So much so that companies have had to start programs to train talent themselves so that they can fill available positions, such as Red Ventures' [Road to Hire](https://www.roadtohire.org/).

While I find the education imparted by most institutions to be lacking, it is not, obviously, entirely devoid of value. I think it is possible to take the nuggets of information gleaned over time spent in the education system and use them as a foundation for a solid, intuitive, understanding of the what, why, and how of web development; and thusly help readers find a suitable job for themselves.
