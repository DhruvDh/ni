<p>This is an <a href="https://github.com/DhruvDh/ni">open-source website</a> that is written with the intention of getting an average student of Computer Science or the like getting them up to speed on the intricacies of modern web development.</p>
<p>I think that teaching something, particularly computer science, is not as easy of a task to accomplish as most teachers and professors tend to think of it as, and neither is learning it. And as a result of this many students find them in a situation where they diligently did all that tasks that lead to academic success in the program they were enrolled in and yet they do not feel like they have attained the required skills to perform or land the job that they are expected to land.</p>
<p>For many students, the cracks in the confidence they have in their own skills start appearing way before it is time to look for a job, and they have trouble doing coursework that others seem to be able to <em>just do</em> without too much of a fuss. They start to think that there is something lacking within them, and that this lacking is the reason they can't perform as well as they wish to.</p>
<p>I happen to think that more often than not, this lacking is not within a student, but rather in the way they are taught and encouraged to think about things. And I also think this situation tends to be a reality more often in third world countries, where education systems tend to believe that they cannot afford to be idealistic and compromise on the education they provide.</p>
<p>As to what exactly I think it is that is lacking, I am not sure this is the best place to talk about such things. Instead, if you are curious, I would direct you towards a chapter in the book &quot;Surely, you're joking Mr. Feynman&quot; <code>[1]</code>, where Dr. Richard Feynman - a noble prize winning physicist who is considered by many to be one of the best teachers of his time - gives a speech about his experience teaching in a third-world country (Brazil), and what he thinks about the state of the education system there. I believe not much has changed since.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of resources to teach yourself web development from. I do not like most of them though, they tend to be a little to algorithmic.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, they're the most popular resource for learning the fundamentals of web development (ranked <code>#143</code> among <em>all websites</em> globally by traffic, as of 10/29/2019 <code>[1]</code>), and most of their tutorials are of the form -</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine you are in this state,</li>
<li>Imagine you want to do this,</li>
<li>This is how you do it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_html.asp">random page</a> from their JavaScript material, it does seem to skip the first step, it goes -</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine you want to write to the HTML document,</li>
<li>Do <code>document.write()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Later in the page they go -</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine you want to change the HTML content,</li>
<li>Do <code>document.getElementByID(id).innerHTML = newHTML</code></li>
</ol>
<p>What a student that learns this way ends up with is a large set of how-to's in their head which they attempt to recall when the appropriate situation arises.</p>

<p>The annoying part about these tutorials is how quickly they take you from not knowing much about something to being able to visibly make things happen and feel like you've accomplished something, while only giving you a very shallow understanding on things.</p>
<p>This is very much like how most elementary math teachers approach teaching -</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine you want to find the area of a rectangle.</li>
<li>Do <code>length * breath</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Most people tend to think of learning as being equivalent to going from a state of not being able to do something to a state where one is capable of doing something. Rather, I've always thought that the act of learning is to go from a state of not being able to figure out how to do something - and therefore being incapable of doing it - to a state of knowing enough to be able to figure out how to do something.</p>
<p>This is a small but important distinction, and the latter is also how this website will attempt to teach. Rather than</p>
<p>Both ways of thinking about learning do seem to end with one transitioning to a state of being able to do something, and as such there are many who think of them as being the same thing.</p>
<p>This is probably a direct consequence of how we choose to grade students during their schooling. Consider a child learning basic geometry.</p>
<p>Both ways of thinking about learning do seem to have similar consequences, and as such people tend to think of them as meaning the same thing. While it is true that both end up with one being in a state of being able to do something, the latter</p>
<p>I've always thought that learning something is not equivalent to going from a state of not being able to do something, to being able to do something <em>doing</em> something, but rather to figure out <em>how</em> to do that something.</p>
<p>I've always thought that most teaching is a bit too algorithmic in nature,For instance,</p>
<p>I've always imagined concepts and branches of study as these rooms in one's head, filled with everything one knows about them. For example, consider <code>Basic Geometry</code> -</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#wip-why-web-development" id="wip-why-web-development">WIP: Why web development?</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so I don't like the current state of education - how does one go from there to writing about web development?</p>
<p>In the years following the first launch of the iPhone and the subsequent flurry of Android phones the value proposition of a smartphone application or a web application for any consumer-facing business and increased exponentially.</p>
<p>Now about a decade later there is an excess of job opportunities for someone who is capable developer of applications or 'apps`, and not enough trained talent. So much so that companies have had to start programs to train talent themselves so that they can fill available positions, such as Red Ventures' <a href="https://www.roadtohire.org/">Road to Hire</a>.</p>
<p>While I find the education imparted by most institutions to be lacking, it is not, obviously, entirely devoid of value. I think it is possible to take the nuggets of information gleaned over time spent in the education system and use them as a foundation for a solid, intuitive, understanding of the what, why, and how of web development; and thusly help readers find a suitable job for themselves.</p>

<p>Hi! I am going to try to teach you how to make Progressive Web Apps!</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-are-progressive-web-apps" id="what-are-progressive-web-apps">What are Progressive Web Apps?</a></h2>
<p>I thought I could just find an article explaining what they are and link them here and that would be the end of that. But apparently people have trouble explaining what they are, and I mostly ran across meta-articles explaining <a href="https://medium.com/@amberleyjohanna/seriously-though-what-is-a-progressive-web-app-56130600a093">why it's hard to explain what progressive web apps are</a> 😆.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to write about it myself.</p>
<p>I think most people know what 'apps' are, they're short for applications, and that OS's like <code>Windows</code>, <code>Android</code>, <code>iOS</code>, <code>Mac</code>, etc. have apps, which you can use to do something.</p>
<p>For instance, I can use the <code>Snapchat</code> app to send pictures or videos to someone, or the <code>Instagram</code> app to share pictures. We also all seem to intuitively understand that an developer has to develop an app for each platform (<code>Android</code>, <code>iOS</code>, etc.) for us to be able to use those apps on those platforms.</p>
<p>For instance, one cannot install <code>iMessage</code> on Android, no matter how determined one is to do so, and many of us also understand why that is so, although some don't. I will try to explain that as well.</p>
<p>You see, people write applications by writing code, or by programming, and telling the Operating System what to do, or what was done, which in turn tells the processing units in your device what to do, and then things happen!</p>
<p>For instance, on this page, write this in this code -</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">document.getElementById('what-are-progressive-web-apps').style.color = &quot;yellow&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>What it would do is that it would tell the browser to change the color of the text of the heading for this section to yellow, and then the browser would communicate this to the Operating system, and then the Operating System would co-ordinate with the hardware in your device attempting to bring about this change and eventually, the color would change.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR
    A(Page) --&gt; B(Browser)
    B(Browser) --&gt; C(OS)
    C(OS) --&gt; D(Hardware)
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say that one fine afternoon we decide to create two variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, both of which we set to <code>2</code>, and we make a third variable <code>c</code> which we decree should be equal to the sum of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. If we were doing all this in Javascript, what we write should end up looking like this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let a = 2;
let b = 2;

let c = a + b;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, on that fine afternoon, if we also decide to print out the value of <code>c</code> with a function like <code>console.log(c)</code> and run this little script with a Javascript runtime like <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, we would see the sum of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> printed out -</p>
<p><img src="/ni/img/aplusb_1.svg" alt="Output" /></p>
<p>Which is <code>2 + 2</code> and thusly <code>4</code>. At this point if, rather miraculously, we still want to play around with our variables and haven't opened Netflix in a new tab, then we might try changing the the value of either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> - just for some mischief.</p>
<p>Doing that and printing out <code>c</code> again all written down in code would look something like this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let a = 2;
let b = 2;

let c = a + b;
console.log(c);

a = 3;
console.log(c);
</code></pre>
<p>Which if we run, again in a Javascript runtime like Node, would leave us with this output -</p>
<p><img src="/ni/img/aplusb_2.svg" alt="Output" /></p>
<p>Uhm, hold up. Yeah, this afternoon sucks but how is it that <code>c</code> prints out as <code>4</code> the second time around too? </p>
<p>We did tell javascript to let <code>c</code> be <em>equal</em> to <code>a + b</code>; and seeing as how <code>a + b</code> is now <code>3 + 2</code>, shouldn't javascript be printing out <code>5</code> the second time we print <code>c</code>?</p>
<p>But evidently that's not what Javascript did, as <code>c</code> was still <code>4</code>. We can only conclude that Javascript is a spoilt little brat that does not to what it's told. It is seemingly deceiving us into thinking that <code>c</code> is equal to <code>a + b</code> when it most certainly isn't.</p>
<p>At this point there maybe some of you whose brains were marred by an education in Computer Science thinking that, well, there's nothing particularly wrong here, and that Javascript is innocent because when we wrote <code>let c = a + b;</code>, we did not actually set <code>c</code> to be equal to <code>a + b</code>; we simply stored the <em>current</em> value of <code>a + b</code> into <code>c</code> - which happened to be <code>4</code> at the time. And as such it remains to be <code>4</code> for the rest of <code>c</code>'s existence until we store a different value there.</p>
<p>These are the same kinds of people that would tell you that \( sin^2(x) \) is equal to \( (sin(x))^2 \) but \( sin^{-1}(x) \) is not equal to \( \frac{1}{sin(x)} \); just haters of anything that's sound and sensible.</p>
<p>They would also say that this is just how it works and that we should follow it or face doom and gloom; and they're probably right. That being said, it is also very easy to imagine a parallel universe in which variables, once declared to be equal to something else (say <code>a + b</code>), actually stay equal to that something else. That universe, I think, would be much nicer to live in too but you probably need a little convincing to see why that is so.</p>
<p>Let's think about websites for a moment, like the one you're on now. Almost all websites follow a simple pattern - you have some data, your intention is to show that data to users of your website, and you use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a> to make sure said data looks pretty when shown. Let's take instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/">it's not just an app!</a>) as an example,the posts are data, the follower count is data, the comments on a post are data, the number of likes is data. Once you're on someone's profile page or someone's post, your computer or phone asks for the relevant data, instagram's servers responds with said data, and then somewhere in the code for Instagram the Instagram website would be a line that does something like this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">document
    .getElementByID(&quot;NameOfPlaceWhereLikesAreShown&quot;)
    .text = &quot;Liked by &quot; + randomLiker.name + &quot; and &quot; + noOfLikers + &quot; others&quot;;
// generates the &quot;liked by&quot; message and makes the relevant part of the website display it
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>&quot;Liked by &quot; + randomLiker.name + &quot; and &quot; + noOfLikers + &quot; others&quot;</code> is what generates the messages like the following -</p>
<p><img src="/ni/img/liked_by_message.png" alt="Liked by message" /></p>
<p>While what <code>document.getElementByID(&quot;NameOfPlaceWhereLikesAreShown&quot;).text</code> does is that it finds the place where we need to display the &quot;liked by&quot; message and set's its text to be equal to the &quot;liked by&quot; message we just generated.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, let's not worry about how we display the &quot;liked by&quot; message and simply assume that there is a <code>displayText</code> variable whose value will end up being shown where we need to show the &quot;liked by&quot; message. So we generate the message like so -</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let displayText = &quot;Liked by &quot; + numberOfLikers + &quot; others&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>The interesting thing to note here is that this particular piece of code does do a very similar job to the earlier <code>let c = a + b;</code> line - it sets a variable to be a certain value based on the values of other variables. There just happen to be 3 variables instead of 2, and they happen to be &quot;adding&quot; strings instead of numbers.</p>
<p>It also suffers from the same problems of javascript being dumb - when <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> changes, the value of <code>c</code> doesn't react to that change, and remains equal to the old, incorrect value. Similarly here, when people keep liking your post because of course they do, the value of <code>displayText</code> won't react, or change and will remain equal to the old value.</p>
<p>At this point, people who make websites have 2 options, either they are okay with the data they show being old, and incorrect, and hope that the user would refresh or reload the page if he or she wants the latest and greatest, or they have to do lots of javascript and client-server gymnastics to ensure that the data being shown is always the newest.</p>
<p>The way it works is that on the client-side, that is on your computer, they watch for people clicking the &quot;like&quot; button and then update the &quot;numberOfLikes&quot; variable whenever that happens, and then also update the &quot;displayText&quot; message whenever <em>that</em> happens, and also at the same time send a message to the sever saying &quot;yo, this dude likes this&quot;. Which might not seem like a whole lot of work, but when you have to do it for each and everything you are displaying on your application of website that is capable of changing it does add up to be a whole lot of work for us to do just to cover up for Javascript being dumb.</p>
<p>This is a frequent pain for everyone who develops websites and applications, not only do they have to instruct a computer or a phone about what data to display, how to display it in a pretty way, but also having to explain in tedious detail to said phone or computer on how to react to changes in data according to a users expectations.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why a universe in which once you set <code>c</code> to be equal to <code>a + b</code>, it would actually stay equal to <code>a + b</code> forever, and not just until something changes the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> be a much nicer universe to live in. You'd just have to explain how to display the data in a pretty way, and there would be no need to explain how to react to changes in data - it would do that on its own.</p>
<p>Next up we're going to have another amazing afternoon where we try to wrestle javascript into making good on it's promise of making something equal to something else.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#making-javascript-reactive" id="making-javascript-reactive">Making Javascript Reactive</a></h1>

<p>In regard to education in Brazil, I had a very interesting experience. I was teaching a group of students who would ultimately become teachers, since at that time there were not many opportunities in Brazil for a highly trained person in science. These students had already had many courses, and this was to be their most advanced course in electricity and magnetism ­­ Maxwell's equations, and so on. The university was located in various office buildings throughout the city, and the course I taught met in a building which overlooked the bay.</p>
<p>I discovered a very strange phenomenon: I could ask a question, which the students would answer immediately. But the next time I would ask the question ­­ the same subject, and the same question, as far as I could tell ­­ they couldn't answer it at all!
For instance, one time I was talking about polarized light, and I gave them all some strips
of polaroid.</p>
<p>Polaroid passes only light whose electric vector is in a certain direction, so I
explained how you could tell which way the light is polarized from whether the polaroid is dark or light. We first took two strips of polaroid and rotated them until they let the most light through. From doing that we could tell that the two strips were now admitting light polarized in the same direction ­­ what passed through one piece of polaroid could also pass through the other. But then I asked them how one could tell the absolute direction of polarization, for a single piece of polaroid.
They hadn't any idea. 
I knew this took a certain amount of ingenuity, so I gave them a hint: &quot;Look at the light reflected from the bay outside.&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody said anything.</p>
<p>Then I said, &quot;Have you ever heard of Brewster's Angle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir! Brewster's Angle is the angle at which light reflected from a medium with an index of refraction is completely polarized.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And which way is the light polarized when it's reflected?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The light is polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflection, sir.&quot; Even now, have to think about it; they knew it cold! They even knew the tangent of the angle equals the index!</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Well?&quot;</p>
<p>Still nothing. They had just told me that light reflected from a medium with an index, such as the bay outside, was polarized; they had even told me which way it was polarized.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Look at the bay outside, through the polaroid. Now turn the polaroid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh, it's polarized!&quot; they said.</p>
<p>After a lot of investigation, I finally figured out that the students had memorized everything, but they didn't know what anything meant. When they heard &quot;light that is reflected from a medium with an index,&quot; they didn't know that it meant a material such as water. They didn't know that the &quot;direction of the light&quot; is the direction in which you see something when you're looking at it, and so on. Everything was entirely memorized, yet nothing had been translated into meaningful words. So if I asked, &quot;What is Brewster's Angle?&quot; I'm going into the computer with the right keywords. But if I say, &quot;Look at the water,&quot; nothing happens ­­ they don't have anything under &quot;Look at the water&quot;!</p>
<p>Later I attended a lecture at the engineering school. The lecture went like this, translated into English: &quot;Two bodies... are considered equivalent... if equal torques... will produce... equal acceleration. Two bodies, are considered equivalent, if equal torques, will produce equal acceleration.&quot; The students were all sitting there taking dictation, and when the professor repeated the sentence, they checked it to make sure they wrote it down all right. Then they wrote down the next sentence, and on and on. I was the only one who knew the professor was talking about objects with the same moment of
inertia, and it was hard to figure out.</p>
<p>I didn't see how they were going to learn anything from that. Here he was talking about moments of inertia, but there was no discussion about how hard it is to push a door open when you put heavy weights on the outside, compared to when you put them near the hinge nothing! </p>
<p>After the lecture, I talked to a student: &quot;You take all those notes ­­ what do you do with them?&quot; &quot;Oh, we study them,&quot; he says. &quot;We'll have an exam.&quot;
&quot;What will the exam be like?&quot;
&quot;Very easy. I can tell you now one of the questions.&quot; He looks at his notebook and says, &quot; 'When are two bodies equivalent?' And the answer is, 'Two bodies are considered equivalent if equal torques will produce equal acceleration.' &quot; So, you see, they could pass the examinations, and &quot;learn&quot; all this stuff, and not know anything at all, except what they had memorized. </p>
<p>Then I went to an entrance exam for students coming into the engineering school. It was an oral exam, and I was allowed to listen to it. One of the students was absolutely super: He answered everything nifty! The examiners asked him what diamagnetism was, and he answered it perfectly. Then they asked, &quot;When light comes at an angle through a sheet of material with a certain thickness, and a certain index N, what happens to the light?&quot;
&quot;It comes out parallel to itself, sir ­­ displaced.&quot;
&quot;And how much is it displaced?&quot;
&quot;I don't know, sir, but I can figure it out.&quot; So he figured it out. He was very good. But I had, by this time, my suspicions. After the exam I went up to this bright young man, and explained to him that I was from the United States, and that I wanted to ask him some questions that would not affect the result of his examination in any way. The first question I ask is, &quot;Can you give me some example of a diamagnetic substance?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot; Then I asked, &quot;If this book was made of glass, and I was looking at something on the table through it, what would happen to the image if I tilted the glass?&quot;
&quot;It would be deflected, sir, by twice the angle that you've turned the book.&quot;
I said, &quot;You haven't got it mixed up with a mirror, have you?&quot;
&quot;No, sir!&quot; He had just told me in the examination that the light would be displaced, parallel to itself, and therefore the image would move over to one side, but would not be turned by any angle. He had even figured out how much it would be displaced, but he didn't realize that a piece of glass is a material with an index, and that his calculation had applied to my question.</p>
<p>I taught a course at the engineering school on mathematical methods in physics, in which I tried to show how to solve problems by trial and error. It's something that people don't usually learn, so I began with some simple examples of arithmetic to illustrate the method. I was surprised that only about eight out of the eighty or so students turned in the first assignment. So I gave a strong lecture about having to actually try it, not just sit back and watch me do it. After the lecture some students came up to me in a little delegation, and told me that I didn't understand the backgrounds that they have, that they can study without doing the problems, that they have already learned arithmetic, and that this stuff was beneath them. So I kept going with the class, and no matter how complicated or obviously advanced the work was becoming, they were never handing a damn thing in. Of course I realized what it was: They couldn't do it!</p>
<p>One other thing I could never get them to do was to ask questions. Finally, a student explained it to me: &quot;If I ask you a question during the lecture, afterwards everybody will be telling me, 'What are you wasting our time for in the class? We're trying to learn something. And you're stopping him by asking a question'.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a kind of one­upmanship, where nobody knows what's going on, and they'd put the other one down as if they did know. They all fake that they know, and if one student admits for a moment that something is confusing by asking a question, the others take a high­handed attitude, acting as if it's not confusing at all, telling him that he's wasting their time. I explained how useful it was to work together, to discuss the questions, to talk it over, but they wouldn't do that either, because they would be losing face if they had to ask someone else. </p>
<p>It was pitiful! All the work they did, intelligent people, but they got themselves into this funny state of mind, this strange kind of self­propagating &quot;education&quot; which is meaningless, utterly meaningless!</p>
<p>At the end of the academic year, the students asked me to give a talk about my experiences of teaching in Brazil. At the talk there would be not only students, but professors and government officials, so I made them promise that I could say whatever I
wanted. They said, &quot;Sure. Of course. It's a free country.&quot; So I came in, carrying the elementary physics textbook that they used in the first year of college. They thought this book was especially good because it had different kinds of typeface ­­ bold black for the most important things to remember, lighter for less important things, and so on. </p>
<p>Right away somebody said, &quot;You're not going to say anything bad about the textbook, are you? The man who wrote it is here, and everybody thinks it's a good textbook.&quot;
&quot;You promised I could say whatever I wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>The lecture hall was full. I started out by defining science as an understanding of the behavior of nature. Then I asked, &quot;What is a good reason for teaching science? Of course, no country can consider itself civilized unless. . . yak, yak, yak.&quot; They were all sitting there nodding, because I know that's the way they think.</p>
<p>Then I say, &quot;That, of course, is absurd, because why should we feel we have to keep up with another country? We have to do it for a good reason, a sensible reason; not just because other countries do.&quot; Then I talked about the utility of science, and its
contribution to the improvement of the human condition, and all that ­­ I really teased them a little bit. Then I say, &quot;The main purpose of my talk is to demonstrate to you that no science is being taught in Brazil!&quot;</p>
<p>I can see them stir, thinking, &quot;What? No science? This is absolutely crazy! We have all these classes.&quot; So I tell them that one of the first things to strike me when I came to Brazil was to see elementary school kids in bookstores, buying physics books. There are so many kids learning physics in Brazil, beginning much earlier than kids do in the United States, that it's amazing you don't find many physicists in Brazil ­­ why is that? So many kids are working so hard, and nothing comes of it. Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek language, who knows that in his own country there aren't many children studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where he is delighted to find everybody studying Greek ­­ even the 
smaller kids in the elementary schools. He goes to the examination of a student who is coming to get his degree in Greek, and asks him, &quot;What were Socrates' ideas on the relationship between Truth and Beauty?&quot; ­­ and the student can't answer. Then he asks the student, &quot;What did Socrates say to Plato in the Third Symposium?&quot; the student lights up and goes, &quot;Brrrrrrrrr­up&quot; ­­ he tells you everything, word for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.</p>
<p>But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was the relationship between Truth and Beauty!</p>
<p>What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another country learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters, then the words, and then sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for word, what Socrates said, without realizing that those Greek words actually mean something. To the student they are all artificial sounds. Nobody has ever translated them into words the students can understand.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;That's how it looks to me, when I see you teaching the kids 'science' here in Brazil.&quot; (Big blast, right?)
Then I held up the elementary physics textbook they were using. &quot;There are no experimental results mentioned anywhere in this book, except in one place where there is a ball, rolling down an inclined plane, in which it says how far the ball got after one second, two seconds, three seconds, and so on. The numbers have 'errors' in them ­­ that is, if you look at them, you think you're looking at experimental results, because the numbers are a little above, or a little below, the theoretical values. The book even talks about having to correct the experimental errors ­­ very fine. The trouble is, when you calculate the value of the acceleration constant from these values, you get the right answer. But a ball rolling down an inclined plane, if it is actually done, has an inertia to get it to turn, and will, if you do the experiment, produce five­sevenths of the right answer, because of the extra energy needed to go into the rotation of the ball. Therefore this single example of experimental 'results' is obtained from a fake experiment. Nobody had rolled such a ball, or they would never have gotten those results! &quot;I have discovered something else,&quot; I continued. &quot;By flipping the pages at random, and putting my finger in and reading the sentences on that page, I can show you what's the matter ­­ how it's not science, but memorizing, in every circumstance. Therefore I am brave enough to flip through the pages now, in front of this audience, to put my finger in, to read, and to show you.&quot; So I did it. Brrrrrrrup ­­ I stuck my finger in, and I started to read:  &quot;Triboluminescence. Triboluminescence is the light emitted when crystals are crushed...
&quot;
I said, &quot;And there, have you got science? No! You have only told what a word means in terms of other words. You haven't told anything about nature ­­ what crystals produce light when you crush them, why they produce light. Did you see any student go home and try it? He can't. &quot;But if, instead, you were to write, 'When you take a lump of sugar and crush it with a pair of pliers in the dark, you can see a bluish flash. Some other crystals do that too. Nobody knows why. The phenomenon is called &quot;triboluminescence.&quot; ' Then someone will go home and try it. Then there's an experience of nature.&quot; I used that example to show them, but it didn't make any difference where I would have put my finger in the book; it was like that everywhere.
Finally, I said that I couldn't see how anyone could be educated by this self­ propagating system in which people pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything. &quot;However,&quot; I said, &quot;I must be wrong. There were two Students
in my class who did very well, and one of the physicists I know was educated entirely in Brazil. Thus, it must be possible for some people to work their way through the system, bad as it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, after I gave the talk, the head of the science education department got up and said, &quot;Mr. Feynman has told us some things that are very hard for us to hear, but it appears to be that he really loves science, and is sincere in his criticism. Therefore, I think we should listen to him. I came here knowing we have some sickness in our system of education; what I have learned is that we have a cancer!&quot; ­­and he sat down. </p>
<p>That gave other people the freedom to speak out, and there was a big excitement. Everybody was getting up and making suggestions. The students got some committee to­ gether to mimeograph the lectures in advance, and they got other committees organized to do this and that.</p>
<p>Then something happened which was totally unexpected for me. One of the students got up and said, &quot;I'm one of the two students whom Mr. Feynman referred to at the end of his talk. I was not educated in Brazil; I was educated in Germany, and I've just come to Brazil this year.&quot; The other student who had done well in class had a similar thing to say. And the professor I had mentioned got up and said, &quot;I was educated here in Brazil during the war, when, fortunately, all of the professors had left the university, so I learned everything by reading alone. Therefore I was not really educated under the Brazilian system.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't expect that. I knew the system was bad, but 100 percent ­­ it was terrible!</p>
<p>Since I had gone to Brazil under a program sponsored by the United States Government, I was asked by the State Department to write a report about my experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the essentials of the speech I had just given. I found out later 
through the grapevine that the reaction of somebody in the State Department was, &quot;That shows you how dangerous it is to send somebody to Brazil who is so naive. Foolish fellow; he can only cause trouble. He didn't understand the problems.&quot; Quite the contrary! I think this person in the State Department was naive to think that because he saw a university with a list of courses and descriptions, that's what it was.</p>
