<p>Everything on this website is still a Work in Progress and not ready for

<p>This page lays out the reason this website exists, and how it attempts to help. If you're here just to learn, feel free to skip this page and go on to [the next one](1_introduction.ht ml).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an <a href="https://github.com/DhruvDh/ni">open-source website</a> that is written with the intention of getting an average student of Computer Science or the like getting them up to speed on the intricacies of modern web development.</p>
<p>I think that teaching something, particularly computer science, is not as easy of a task to accomplish as most teachers and professors tend to think of it as, and neither is learning it. And as a result of this many students find them in a situation where they diligently did all that tasks that lead to academic success in the program they were enrolled in and yet they do not feel like they have attained the required skills to perform or land the job that they are expected to land.</p>
<p>For many students, the cracks in the confidence they have in their own skills start appearing way before it is time to look for a job, and they have trouble doing coursework that others seem to be able to <em>just do</em> without too much of a fuss. They start to think that there is something lacking within them, and that this lacking is the reason they can't perform as well as they wish to.</p>
<p>I happen to think that more often than not, this lacking is not within a student, but rather in the way they are taught and encouraged to think about things. And I also think this situation tends to be a reality more often in third world countries, where education systems tend to believe that they cannot afford to be idealistic and compromise on the education they provide.</p>
<p>As to what exactly I think it is that is lacking, I am not sure this is the best place to talk about such things. Instead, if you are curious, I would direct you towards a chapter in the book &quot;Surely, you're joking Mr. Feynman&quot; <code>[1]</code>, where Dr. Richard Feynman - a noble prize winning physicist who is considered by many to be one of the best teachers of his time - gives a speech about his experience teaching in a third-world country (Brazil), and what he thinks about the state of the education system there. I believe not much has changed since.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#why-web-development" id="why-web-development">Why web development?</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so I don't like the current state of education - how does one go from there to writing about web development?</p>
<p>Simply put, I view web development as one of the easiest skills to attain that
loads of companies would want to pay you for. When I talked earlier about how
most institutions are not very good at teaching computer science, I also made
the assumption that any student that's enrolled in such an institution has formed
some level of apathy towards it. There are many who find it within themselves
the motivation to push through and learn what they need to on their own, but at
the same time there would be many who would be turned off by all of it; and only
look at it as a means of making money.</p>
<p>I think web development is a way to make money without requiring a whole lot of
investment. Data science/machine learning/game development/NLP/computer vision
all require foundational knowledge that is not easy to attain especially if the
student is not that interested. While for the most part what you need to know
to be a web developer is knowledge of HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. All of which I
consider to be relatively easy to attain.</p>
<p>I am not entirely sure what is making my gut so sure that web development is the
way to go. Perhaps it is the fact that it is easy to build confidence with
HTML/CSS, JavaScript when every little tiny piece of code you write has some
sort of an immediate feedback you can see and interact with. You wrote <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
somewhere? Great now you have something to click at. Did you put a <code>link</code>
tag adding a style-sheet? The entire web-page suddenly changed! Or maybe it
didn't change? In general there tends to be an easy, intuitive way to debug -
maybe it couldn't find the file where the styles were defined, maybe we're not
assigning the styles to the elements we thought we were assigning the styles
to, maybe something is overriding the styles we linked.</p>
<p>Contrast all this with machine learning, you'd have to write a bunch of code and
implement your whole pipeline before you start to see some sort of visible
results! I am not saying that it is very difficult to do, it is also rather
simple - once you have the hang of it. But it is also not something that is easy
to gain confidence in. If your neural network starts outputting a bunch of <code>NaN's</code>
or <code>inf's</code> getting to the root of the problem for a student who's still trying to learn is
a rather painful experience, and easy it is easy to get demotivated.</p>
<p>Recent times the tooling in the JavaScript ecosystem has gotten a lot more
intuitive and easy to work with. The web development world is one of the few
where convenience for developers (employees) is placed higher than needs of the
company/customers. For instance, if you go to a subway the person making your
sandwich is not going to say <em>I'll have to walk alll the way over there just to
get your Jalapeno Cheddar bread, which I don't feel like doing so why don't you
just have Rye bread instead.</em></p>
<p>However, this is something that frequently happens in the web development world,
and developers do tend to put their own convenience over needs of their
customers without their employers getting mad at them.</p>
<p>If you're here just to learn about web development then it is very likely that
most of the last few paragraphs didn't make much sense to you. I can't really do
much about that; you'll just have to trust me for now.</p>
<p><em>Good luck!</em> <br />
